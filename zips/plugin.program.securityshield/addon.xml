	<description>Run this add-on to quickly check your installed add-ons and repo's against the noobsandnerds Add-on Portal database as well as some more advanced features for checking running services etc. The main scan will quickly check if you have any content installed that's no longer working, considered depreciated or marked as potentially dangerous. Keeping old repositories (and potentially some addons) on your system is huge security flaw in the Kodi system so make sure you check regularly. The scan process is extremely quick and should just take a few seconds even with hundreds of add-ons installed.</description>
