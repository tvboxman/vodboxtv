msgid "The following items have been flagged by the community as dangerous and we highly recommend putting them in quarantine now. The most common reason for this is repositories which re-upload others work which is definitely a severe security risk. Often they contain hundreds if not thousands of add-ons which the repo host cannot possibly police and generally everything and anything gets added (malicious or not). If you\'ve previously had add-ons showing as updates available in the past but they refused to update there\'s a very good chance it was one of these repositories causing the issues.[CR][CR][COLOR=dodgerblue]WARNING: [/COLOR]When installing content you should ALWAYS use the official developers repositories, installing from third parties can cause problems and of course whenever you install a repository you are allowing the maintainer of that repo full access to your system. It doesn\'t take a genius to code up malicious spyware or system crippling viruses on the Kodi system - it is VERY vulnerable so always please be vigilant when searching the web and installing content, only install from trusted sources. It\'s worth noting that you can install any add-on via Community Portal and nothing is re-uploaded, absolutely everything comes direct from the original developers repositories and the relavant repo is auto-installed so that is certainly one of the safest ways to install content.[CR][CR]%s[CR][CR][COLOR=dodgerblue]Are you the developer of something listed here?[/COLOR][CR]If you feel something is incorrectly tagged please post on the noobsandnerds forum with any proof you can provide and the team will look into updating the records.
