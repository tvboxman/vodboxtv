v.1.4:
- Cleaned up the artwork renamer code, works much better now.
- Added new option for creating ini files (thanks to primaeval for the addon).
- Tidied up the dialogs so they make a little more sense now.
- Added new icon.
- Added dependency for primaeval repo (addon ini creator).

v.1.2:
- Added renamer file creation, this allows you to scan in an xml file and it will ask what
country these listings are for. A rename file will then be created that you can use when pulling
listings via mc2xml or zap2xml and will add the correct country extension and remove some unwanted text.

v.1.1:
- Initial fork of OTTV Tools (based on v.1.0.5)
- Removed the main menu categories
